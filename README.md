# AI Edge On-Device APIs and SDKs

The AI Edge On-Device APIs and SDKs repository provide a set of libraries that
allow you to easily build end-to-end applications with Google AI Edge's GenAI
pipelines.

## Key Features

### On-Device RAG SDK

The AI Edge On-Device RAG SDK provides fundamental components for constructing a
RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline on device. The SDK's modular
architecture offers easy-to-use abstractions and a variety of concrete
implementations for its key building blocks. The SDK is currently available in
Java.

You can find the SDK on [GitHub](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/ai-edge-apis/tree/main/local_agents/rag)
or follow our [public documentation](https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/genai/rag/android)
to install directly from Maven. We have also published a
[sample app](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/ai-edge-apis/tree/main/examples/rag)
in this repository.

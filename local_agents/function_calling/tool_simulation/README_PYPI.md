# Tool Simulation Library

## Overview

The `tool-simulation` library lets you evaluate and specialize LLMs on a
specific set of tools. The library is designed to be modular, allowing users to
plug in different model backends, prompt formats, and tool simulation logic.

## Set Up

The tool simulation library is available as a Python package. You can install
the library using pip:

```bash
pip install ai-edge-tool-simulation
```

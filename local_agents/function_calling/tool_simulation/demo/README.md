# Tool Simulation Demo Colabs

This directory contains two colabs showing how to use the Tool Simulation
library to generate training/validation data and train a model reproducing
the Function Calling SDK demo.

The Tool Simulation Data and Eval colab shows how to set up data generation
and eval loops. The Hammer FT colab shows a fine-tuning script for a 0.5B Hammer
2.1 model. Please refer to the Function Calling SDK docs to see how you can
deploy your own model.
